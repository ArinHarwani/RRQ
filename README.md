# RoadResQ (RRQ)

## AI-Powered Emergency Response Platform

### 📌 Overview

RoadResQ (RRQ) is a smart, real-time emergency response system designed to reduce delays in medical assistance during critical situations. It connects citizens, ambulance services, hospitals, and family members through a unified digital platform to ensure faster response, better coordination, and improved patient outcomes during the golden hour.

### 🚑 Problem Statement

In India, delayed ambulance arrival, lack of coordination, and absence of immediate first aid guidance result in thousands of preventable deaths each year. RRQ addresses these gaps by enabling instant emergency alerts, intelligent dispatch, and pre-arrival hospital preparedness.

### ⚙️ How It Works

When a user faces a medical emergency, they can trigger a one-tap alert by selecting the emergency type (accident, heart attack, maternal, etc.). The system captures live GPS coordinates (or a saved address) and sends alerts simultaneously to the nearest ambulances and the user’s registered family member. A short cancellation window prevents false alerts. Nearby ambulances receive the request, and the first to accept is guided to the patient using real-time, traffic-optimized navigation. Once accepted, the selected hospital receives emergency details and patient information in advance, enabling faster triage and treatment.
